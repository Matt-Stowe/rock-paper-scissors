How do I want to solve this?

Get the cpu to generate a choice from Rock, Paper or Scissors. 
Random number 1, 2, 3

(Store that value secretly - does this mean that someone could console.log the value and cheat???
Is there a way to obfuscate this in order to halt cheaters? A problem for a diff day maybe?)

Prompt user with choice
Store choice in same syntax that cpu uses
Ensure that failsafe is implemented if user types "blamonge" or something else equally mental.

Do a cool countdown sequence and then present the winner/loser.

Ask a Q: Want to play again? Y/N

Go back to the start of the function and run it until infinity.
Alternatively give a nice little credits screen if the player doesn't want to play any more.
Done???

Ideas: 
- Ask player for their name?
- Keep a high score?
- A leaderboard?!

Pseudocode:
Define Rock = 1, Paper = 2, Scissors = 3;
Randomnumber between 1,2,3.
Print "Choose your weapon: Rock, Paper, Scissors"
Take choice and convert to numbered value.
Compare 1 beats 2, beats 3, beats 1.
Return winner as text string
